  whats the story?

  Clean keypad with optional buttons for 
    Search&show, Create, Update, Remove, db mov << < > >> , 
    OK, Cancel  
  
  It will show and enable-disable buttons depending on
    functions implemented:  db create, db update, ...  
    internal status, 1 of 4:  Idle, showing record, creating new record,  modifing existing record.  


  View behaviour is client js controlled,  critical ops stays on server
    so it should be fast and responsive, reducing delay problems to the actual server db operations 

  The dev user implements simple operations only (forget the onclick !)
    form operations:  clean the form, show a record, create a form for editing
    db operations:    select, insert, update, delete...     
    just that.  
 
  html, css, js, 
  class, events,
