Cleaner: 
-I can put button names in a json file.  Later.  I'll just stop enhancing code related to that
-The class button_crud lets dev modify that and more, add icons, svg; note: dont overwrite this. 
...
to toy with, later
- If I understand event delegation...
1) db file:
May I replace ALL .onsuccess in db section with just ONE line ??  
the panel lets that, no need to code anything extra
 onsuccess  (){ crudpad.result(true) }   
 onerror   (){  crudpad.result (false, msg2user) }   mm... the msg to the user...   
 careful, can fire when I dont want to. 
 Just a few db functions, no need. 
2) crud file
Replace all insane 'this.' onclick listening  whit one ?  There is an advantage:
  waitingfor status in only one place.
...
What if I put an html file (is this a template?) instead of making it from js? Is it
cleaner?
preferred?
I dunno
...
Hate js again
EnumMODE = { 'IDLE':1, 'SHOW':2, 'CREATE':4, 'MODIFY':8, }
this._mode = this.EnumMODE.MODIFY    
would be useful if js let me 
  var  mode  as  EnuMODE     ( Even VB6 had it!  Does TS? )
No way to protect anything. 
js is wonderful tool to fabric bugs.
freedom sucks.
...
internal status waitingFor,  so dev sees only one method for everything result() 
each button registers to _buttons, their onclick can be simpler than now,
plus the unified onclick let me manage waitingFor all in one place, fewer errors.  
...
I dont get html element class extend yet, link still broken.  
Busy tomorrow, hope i ll back with certezas  
no net? no need to commit now, I just hope notebook dont explode.

REAL DATABASE!
Finished -without ANY testing- htm playground with test database indexedDb.  So I can test the panel.
No need to promises. Just events.
With the crudpad in mind, it was too easy.  I wonder if any of these would work. 
...
Didnt implement db NAV yet (cursors). Easy too, with my sql backgound.  I'll  back to it later in the project,
too much code with no idea of how good I'm going.  
...
DB, PAD.  They'll test each other.  Sometime.

BirthWeek  break.  I just left being a teenager, 3th time.  I'm 3 times 20yo young. 
The break will continue while studing promises, I understand them but they are not in my blood yet.

I really was trying to implement firebase, useful knowledge unlike local storage. 
Then node? now?  Everything new here.  Learning from caos, not my first time, like a baby. 
but.
Insane js language, great callbacks, promises, node, firebase, nosql, dom, they all first time.
and no way to test any until everything is setup and in armony.  
Stop overwelm.
Indexeddb is complex, maybe too complex. But it has what I need, solid test for my first app.
Stll, either way, I have to finish it without even one test...  Until I get some crudpad done.
but If I do things right design errors in one project wont make the other deprecated.  
...
result(true/false)  is ok. but I keep thinking what if.  
onerror, onsuccess sound more familiar to dev,
would it put the complexity on the wrong side?  ?
But the message would target to exactly where it was called, thats the beauty of promises
If I understand.
Maybe I can think aubout it later, buy it feels like one of the starting paradigms.
YES.  Depends on how difficult is for dev to fire them.  result() is easier. 
F freecodecamp only barely teach async inside frameworks part.  I WON'T DO iT.  Vanilla is my goal, 
vanilla will be my schooling.  By the time I "finish" learning all frameworks will be deprecated. lol!
hopefully js deprecated too. It needs to be rebuilt.



19-05-07

Fatal github empty server response?  Okey.
Uf. Need to do test db app. Real, no fake.  Promises, promises, promises...



19-05-06

Keeping playground local. "confirm" was a good practice. 
But still the code here is completely untested. (may I say: Cool! or Doomed!)
Taking longer than I expected.  But it WILL be a burst. I ll finish this soon. 
...
Still Hate JS
...
JS naming nightmare.  No way to ensure integrity, 
intellisense is pretty dumb,  It CAN'T BE GOOD with this language!!! 
I cant do arrays of objects, anonymous or fancy abstractions, not here,
the pad is pretty complex and distictive elements, I need NAMES.  Lots of.  
No integrity check, and they became properties?  FY!!!
But I can do better.  No exposed names for button properties, 
just expose the buttons themselves to Dev and let him change everything from text to tips, icons and animations;
but Do I need the expose? or just naming it right is then well showed? Maybe. Maybe crudpad.buttons is clearer,
just like crudpad.customButtons. Ill keep separated cause of different implementations.
...
Still hate js, but the async thing is the coolest. You are the boss, 
you dont wait until your minions finish their job.  You just tell them what to do 
and go do something else.  Its REAL multitask, cause you are not doing it.
The first word in every js tutorial should be: ASYNC
Wow, forgot to stage commit push publish or wathever.



19-05-03

Callbacks here?  YES! ...maybe. If I understand, 
needed on element onload to ensure I enable controls when they are ready,
where should I put them? Can I put only one for the entire div?  DOM!!!!
Library, here I go again.



19-05-02

Im back.  No dispatch. No callbacks either.  No place to practice them here, if there is a SIMPLEr way. Ha!! KISS.
Should do practice II: litul-form to bind litul-crud.  No way, Im not going to make a framework for myself.  
Just schooling myself.   I NEED to practice server related code!!!
Internal names madness...
Doing everything with absolutely no test.  I am crazy?  Too confident? What a debug awaits.
The log is longer than my code!  Log is dreams and hopes.  And encouraging too.  Dear diary...



19-04-27

onclick events from crud buttons.  They all async.  But the callback has to be managed by dev. So:
- addEventListener and a series of event types for dev to dispatch?  is worth the effort ?
or 
- crudPad.result(true/false) function as I origininally tought dev has to call after he receives the callback
Looks the same job for dev.  dispatch(somethingok)  or result(ok), he controls the timing anyway.




19-04-26

F kidding me.  No local var inside classes???  this._MADNESS.
DOM goes crazy.  With no f way for js to check integrity, 
It would be better if I text instead of doing fancy objects
    like this: innerHTML = "<div id='divcrud' ><button id 'btnew' class 'dadada'  etc
Hate js. Again.
Anyway, more code: 
DOM, set methods for dev, modes, enabling div & buttons.  Next: hidden handlers  then test app



19-04-25

readonly and private properties   _    # ll be standard when I start the real code... 
"pad" instead of menu, buttonpanel or whatever 
"setCreate()" instead of implementCreate() 



19-04-24

some backbone code wo testing. 
need to finish fakecrud test first
going crazy, where code goes? construct, class, outside, _fun get set , vars ,  CONTEXT!!! where????
where to store main vars from implements()? outside class? 
wtf this and onclick  ????  ruined all clean code atempt.  Wont put tst code here.
just realized I need a firing method cause you cant define everything on start. First implements.() then fire.
Crazy slow... Time to switch to 2 my new Mint partition? I dont like Mint very much and I feel lazy to try other
but 700MB "antimalware service" 20%cpu "system interupsts" too much
stop it!
Another rock in the way, back to javascript.info



19-04-22

I just realized I hate JS. It's not me, it is something else. 
How can I protect the code from idiots like me?
Too much debug.  
I now understand the frameworks and tools, they are proliferating because of bad languajes.
stiling to easy test, debug and control. why? Because the languaje failure.
Too much debug.  Long ago, a project lider told me "your code doesnt have bugs!" No, never.
I have to focus on customer needs, not code. 
Of course I have mistakes, but when the code COMPILES OK, I KNOW there are no more bugs. 
The first in the project, the old notebook made of paper.  Data, process, relations, the BIG picture. 
Then code: Declaration, types, well designed custom types, enums, context, NEVER parameters inside " ".
Add new properties to system objects and types, really? 
No warning, just does. "Oh. I tought you put .leg on purpose!"
Freedom? You can walk the big garden straight without following any path and you MAY reach your goal earlier.
dont be surprised for the time you spend later cleaning the mud and broken flowers from yours shoes and pants.  

I have to finish this, it's the process.  
It is still important. Like the horrible NTSC before cable (against PAL/SECAM), the standard to buy... in USA.
Then Node.
Then no framework, languaje first.  Maybe TS.  



19-04-20

Needing more background here... Still fighting async.
To do, rewrite fake crud app, localStorage with fake async response is crazy, indexedDB 
is a real async app and test... 
Should I test real latency problems? Looking for free cloud DB storages now.

Panel thinking:   
add custom confirm and custom msg inside panel, no popups. 
Status via backgound colors would be nice.
Dev op callback 
  .result( ok_true, "msg tudu bem") 
  .result( kaput_false, "kaput your db just crashed" ) 



19-04-17

Break is over.  My sinusitis isn't.  Wanna drill a hole in my head to release... something, anything. Ibuprofeno wont be any help, unless stomach ache become more painful than eyes pain.

Cant help with callback... What if I do a "litul-Form element"?  It should understand "edit mode", "idle mode",
and an special "disabled mode" that wont enable until it receives the msg "paint this THEN enable yourself"
Should I study frameworks with "html templates"?

WTF class get, set...  let  x.status = x.list.nnn ????
to study... again.

Custom buttons will be there. Useful for to localstarage, to pdf, to Xls, etc  



19-04-13

html and js app for the crud panel test. 
Harder than I thought, how to test one each other wo finishing them first  

humpf.  Timeout call!!!  
Need to get cb & dom events better.  freecodecamp sucks here. 
You dont want the user clicking "modify" before the input elements are filled!
javascript.info , I'm going.  



19-04-12

Still thinking phase.
Methods:
1 method to add custom buttons. (without it the panel would be too restrictive )
  onclick is all yours, dev.
  One extra property:  The status (IDLE, SHOWING, EDITING) on wich these buttons would be enabled   

6 methods to define the panel:  paint empty, create, update, remove, search&show, nav.

1 method to tell the panel the result of any op so it can change its status.  
  The result follows the CB that dev should put in its funtions.  
    Still raw.
     To define: 
     Is it ok to receive just true/false for operation sucessful? 
     OR  
     Do I need to check an unexpected result?
          RESULT_MSG = { CREATE_OK, CREATE_FAIL, UPDATE_OK, ...  DRAW_OK, ... etc... }

1 method, optional, to overwrite all buttons names at once (or icons, or svg) 'ok' 'cancel' 'yes' 'no' 'new'...
  Other L&F should be via css I suppose.

more:

set properties for buttons? Maybe not, three options is too much. 
Better Use the method, These four at the beggining.  
  .txtButtonOKname = 'Ok'             // ok / cancel, 
  .txtButtonCancelName = 'Cancel'
  .txtButtonConfirmYesName = 'Yes'   // I hate browser confirm()
  .txtButtonConfirmNoName = 'No'

-When the user is modifying and cancels , status go IDLE and form emptied.  
    Maybe I should give dev option to redraw showing record... not posible if I only have .opResult(false)   

Still Dont like names.        Edit: I DONT CARE! They are just parameter names.
  funXXX_DbXXX()  funcXXX_FormXXX()
  funcXXX_ related to the corresp implementXXX(), 
  then _Dbxxx or FormXXX, form or sql specific op.  Mmm...

Close to the REAL start



19-04-10
to define:

-via events to listen, like an oop interface? (My original VB6 menuABM interface) -I Still dont know how to-  
-via functions as properties?  sounds dirty but js devs are very familiar with them
  like this     crudPanel.funcFormEditNew =  ()->{//displays html for edition }
                crudPanel.funcSqlInsert   =  ()->{//sql insert code}
-via functions as parameters? cleaner
  like this    crudPanel.implementCreate(funcFormEditNew, funcSQLinsert)
-error and feedback management HOW TO!!!!????
  Still thinking how to feedback. How to manage callbacks...  yet KISS. WHERE TF put them?

Maybe:
create custom buttons (onclick will be all yours) able to respond to the panel status  
(i.e.  "Export to xx", only enabled when "showing" status; "Paste from" only in "editing" status )
